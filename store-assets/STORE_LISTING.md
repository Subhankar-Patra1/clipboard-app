📋 CLIPBOARD MANAGER - Never Lose a Copy Again

Tired of Windows' limited clipboard history? Clipboard Manager remembers everything you copy, survives restarts, and keeps your data 100% private.

🔒 PRIVACY-FIRST DESIGN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• 100% Local Storage - All data stored in SQLite on YOUR computer
• No Cloud Sync - Nothing is ever sent to external servers
• No Analytics - Zero tracking or telemetry
• Private Mode - Pause clipboard monitoring for sensitive content
• OTP Auto-Delete - One-time passwords auto-delete after 60 seconds
• Open Source - Review the code yourself on GitHub

📋 POWERFUL CLIPBOARD MANAGEMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Text & Image Support - Captures both text and images
• Unlimited History - No arbitrary limits like Windows' 25-item cap
• Survives Restarts - Your clipboard history persists across reboots
• Smart Deduplication - No more duplicate entries
• Pin Important Items - Keep frequently used clips at the top
• Drag & Drop - Drag clips directly into any application

🔍 ADVANCED SEARCH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Instant Search - Filter clips as you type
• Fuzzy Search - Use ~query for approximate matching
• Regex Search - Use /pattern/ for power users
• Date Filters - Filter by Today, This Week, or All Time

📦 PASTE QUEUE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Queue Mode - Select multiple clips to paste in sequence
• One-Click Paste - Paste the next queued item instantly
• Bulk Operations - Manage multiple clips at once

⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Fast 500ms Clipboard Polling - Near-instant capture
• Thumbnail Generation - Reduced memory usage for images
• Indexed Database - Lightning-fast searches
• Lightweight - Minimal system resources

🎨 MODERN USER EXPERIENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Frameless Design - Sleek, modern appearance
• System Tray Integration - Quick access anytime
• Keyboard Navigation - Navigate with arrow keys
• Auto-Hide - Window hides when not in focus

⌨️ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Alt+V - Toggle clipboard window
• ↑/↓ - Navigate between clips
• Enter - Copy & paste selected clip
• Escape - Dismiss window

💡 WHY CLIPBOARD MANAGER?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Windows' built-in clipboard (Win+V) has frustrating limitations:
✗ Only stores ~25 items
✗ History cleared on restart
✗ No permanent pinning
✗ Basic search only

Clipboard Manager solves all of these with a privacy-first approach.

🆓 FREE & OPEN SOURCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This app is completely free with no ads, no subscriptions, and no hidden costs. The source code is available on GitHub for full transparency.

A better clipboard for power users. Free. Open source. Private.
